Every visualization with `ggplot2` starts with a call to `ggplot()`

```{r out.height='80%', fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}
ggplot() # Create an empty coordinate system.
```

---

In the `ggplot()` function, we specify the data we want to plot

ggplot(data = ESS) # Create an empty coordinate system for the ESS data. 
```

---
layout:false

# First steps in `ggplot2` .font60[Layers]

On top of the coordinate system, we add layers of visualization. The most basic layer describes the kind of visualization we want. All of them start with  `geom_`.

```{r out.height='80%', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(data = ESS) + # Add ...
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs)) # a "layer" of points (i.e., a scatter plot). #<<

`ggplot2` provides an entire family of **geom functions**, which add different types of geometric objects (e.g., points, bars, lines) on top of the coordinate system.

--

- Geom functions depend on the `mapping` argument, which maps/connects variables to elements in your plot. To do this mapping, we use the `aes()` function, which stands for "**aesthetics**". Aesthetics are the _variable_ visual properties of your plot. 

--

- The most central aesthetics of any graph is a data points location in the coordinate system. In `aes()`, we use the arguments `x` and `y` to specify which variable to map to the x-axis and y-axis respectively.

--

- Any variable visual property (color, shape, size, etc.) can be an aesthetic.

---
layout:true
# Aesthetics .font60[The _variable_ visual plot properties]

---

If you want to map or connect an aesthetic to variable, you need to specify it _within_ `aes()`.

```{r out.width='80%', fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = ESS) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs, color = cntry)) # Color by country. #<<
```

???

- ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique level of an aesthetic (e.g., color/shape/size/etc.) to each value of the variable.

- the type of level (distinct or continuous colors) depend on the variable (factor or numeric)

- It will also generate a legend.

---

Depending on what you want to visualize, you can have just `x` and `y` or a whole set of aesthetics.

```{r out.width='70%', fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = ESS) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs, color = cntry,
                           size = pspwght)) # Size by post-stratification weight. #<<
```

???

You can manually control the aesthetics, that is, which color and which sizes. But that is fine tuning. We want to explore our data right now.

---

`ggplot2` tries to be smart with its defaults and will adjust aesthetics to the type of vector you are mapping.

```{r out.width='70%', fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = ESS) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs,
                           color = pspwght, size = cntry)) # Exchanged color and date aes. #<<
```

???

- Now color is gradual, rather than different colors.

- For size, a categorical variable makes little sense.

- Categorical are factor and character vectors.

- continuous are numerical vectors.

---

Static visual properties **are not** aesthetics and need to be specified _outside_ the `aes()` function.

```{r out.width='65%', fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = ESS) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs,
                           size = pspwght, color = cntry),
             shape = 21) # Use hollow circles. #<<
```

???

- Here we specify a constant shape for all data points.

- You need to give static visual properties a value that is sensible.

- We can use the color aestetic in both plots.

- We cannot use shape for lines and line types for points.

- Note that ggplot2 automatically groups data for geoms whenever you map an aesthetic to a categorical variable!

# Geoms .font60[Combining geoms]
---

To have several geoms in one plot, simply add `+` them on top of each other.
```{r out.width='65%', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = ESS) + # Coordinate system, add ...
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs, size = pspwght)) + # layer of points, add ...#<<
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs, weight = pspwght)) # layer of smoothed average & 95%-CI.
```

---

The order of geoms matters, `ggplot2` adds layer on top of layer.
```{r out.width = '65%', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = ESS) + # Coordinate system, add ...
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs, weight = pspwght)) + #<<
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs, size = pspwght)) #<<
```

???

- See how smooth line is under scattered point
  
---
layout:false
layout:true
# Advanced aesthetics .font60[Global or local]

---

To simplify our code, we can specify **global aesthetics** in the `ggplot()` call. These are passed to each layer and hold *for all geoms*.
```{r out.width='63%', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = ESS, mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = eduyrs)) + # Coord. system with global aesthetics, add ... #<<
  geom_point() + # a layer of points, add ...
  geom_smooth() # a layer with a line of locally-smoothed averages and CI.
```

---

By the way, this is a nice example for why graphics are great for data exploration:
```{r out.width='60%', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = ESS, mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = factor(eduyrs))) + # Coord. system with global aesthetics, add ...
  geom_boxplot()  + # a layer of boxplots, add ...
  # For some reason, geom_smooth needs the "aes(group = 1)" argument.
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = 1), se = FALSE) + # No CI (i.e., confidence interval), add ...
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = 1), method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") # an OLS line.
```

???

- Imagine having to read a table that shows all of this,
  - at minimum the trend lines would be hard to get from tables

- Note: needed to remove: weight = pspwght to make this work

---

.center[.alert[Note that local aesthetics override the global aesthetics.]]
```{r out.width='65%', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}

  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = cntry, size = pspwght), alpha = 0.2) + # aes() for geom_point exclusively. #<<
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(y = agea, weight = pspwght)) #<<
```

???

- Global y: attitudes about immigrants (0-10)
- Local smooth y: age (18-90)

# Putting it all together

  geom_boxplot() + # a layer of boxplots, add
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(color = cntry, group = cntry)) # Add smooth for each country.
```

- Now we've got all the ingredients for an informative plot
- But you might say, trends for different countries are hard to read

layout:true
# Facets .font60[Sub-plots by categorical data]
---

Layering and using many aesthetics can create overwhelming plots. In this case smaller replicates (facets) of the same plot might be useful.
```{r out.width='75%', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(data = ESS, mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = factor(eduyrs))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = 1)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ cntry, nrow = 1) # Make sub-plots by cntry. #<<
```

???

- Consider whether faceting helps to see the comparisons you are interested in!
- Note that with facets, it becomes crucial to find appropriate dimensions

---


Replicate plots can also be arranged in a grid for two categorical variables.
```{r out.width='85%', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(data = ESS, mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = factor(eduyrs))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = 1)) +
  facet_grid(gndr ~ cntry) # Make sub-plots by gender (row) ~ country (column). #<<
```

layout:false
# Exporting plots .font60[`ggsave()`]

To enable you to use your plot outside R, `ggplot` provides functionality to export them using the function `ggsave()`. 

You can export your plot to various file types, including pdf, jpeg, png, and many more. `ggsave()` will determine the type from the extension of the name you give to the file (e.g., "MyPlot.pdf").

```{r}
# Make our plot and assign it to object my_plot.
my_plot <- ggplot(data = ESS, mapping = aes(y = imwbcnt, x = factor(eduyrs))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = 1)) +
  facet_grid(gndr ~ cntry)

# Save the plot into the working directory as pdf with the dimensions 9 inches by 4.5 inches.
ggsave(filename = "myplot1.pdf", plot = my_plot, width = 8, height = 3) #<<
```

--

```{r}
# Save the plot but with different dimensions
ggsave(filename = "myplot2.pdf", plot = my_plot, width = 16, height = 9)
```

--

```{r}
# Save the plot as jpeg, with yet different dimensions and very low resolution to reduce the file size.
ggsave(filename = "myplot1.jpeg", plot = my_plot, width = 4.5, height = 9, dpi = 50)
```

???

- Key syntax:
  - filename
  - plot (defaults to most recent)
  - dimensions are optional

- PDFs do not need the dpi argument, because they are vector-based graphics.
