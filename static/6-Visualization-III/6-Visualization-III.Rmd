# Statistical transformations

Geoms have a default `stat` function, which performs the transformation, such as counting.<br> .backgrnote[Vice versa, stats have default geom functions. Chapter 3 of [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) explains how you build graphs based on stats stats rather than geoms.]

# Statistical transformations .font60[**Like a pro** ...]

Oftentimes, we want to do statistical transformations by hand and plot the resulting data.
```{r}
ESS_cntry <- ESS %>% # use the ESS, then
  mutate( # Generate a numeric 0/1 indicator of perceived discrimination.
    rel_discr_num = case_when(rel_discr == "Yes" ~ 1, 
                              rel_discr == "No" ~ 0,
                              TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA))) %>%
  group_by(cntry) %>% # group ESS_minority by cntry, then
  dplyr::summarize( # Start summarize function.
    wn = sum(pspwght, na.rm = TRUE), # weighted number of cases,
    df = (wn^2 / sum(pspwght^2, na.rm = TRUE)), # degrees of freedom,
    wn_rd = sum(rel_discr_num * pspwght, na.rm = TRUE), # weighted number of cases who ...,
    wperc_rd = (wn_rd / wn) * 100, # weighted % who ...,
    wse_rd = sqrt(wperc_rd * (100 - wperc_rd) / wn), # Standard error of the percent,
    wmin95_rd = wperc_rd - wse_rd * qt(p = 0.975, df = df), # Lower bound of 95% CI,
    wmax95_rd = wperc_rd + wse_rd * qt(p = 0.975, df = df) # Upper bound of 95% CI,
  ) # End of summarize.
```

# Statistical transformations .font60[**Like a pro** ...]

If we statistically transform data by ourselves and then wish to plot the resulting data, we have to:
1. Give ggplot2 both `x` and `y` for its coordinate system. 
2. Tell the geom that we do not wish to use the default `stat`, but instead use the statistically-transformed data as raw input without further transformation (i.e., `"identity"`, aka "leave as it").

.push-left[
```{r StatTrans1, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(data = ESS_cntry) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cntry, 
                         y = wperc_rd), 
           stat = "identity") + # Leave as is. #<<
  labs(y = "% Stating They Belong\n to a Discriminated Religious Minority",
       x = "Country")
```

```{r}
ESS_cntry
```
]

.push-right[
```{r ref.label = "StatTrans1", fig.height = 3.4, fig.width = 7.2, echo = FALSE}

???
Again a nice example how we are quicker to pick up the differences in the plot.
