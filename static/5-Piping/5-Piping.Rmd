# Nested code

We have learned that R code may be nested. But too much nesting becomes unintelligible: Because R evaluates code from the inside-out, we need to read nested code from the inside-out!

```{r}
# Nested code
mean(sqrt(seq(from = 1, to = 13)))
```

--

Alternatively, we could write several lines of code successively and read from top to bottom. But this leads to many irrelevant intermediate objects that crowd our environment.

```{r}
# Non-nested code
x <- seq(from = 1, to = 13)
x_sqrt <- sqrt(x) # Intermediate object. #<<
mean(x_sqrt)
```

---
# The (forward) **pipe** `%>%`

The `%>%` operator pipes output of one function as input to the next function. You can basically say: `function(argument1 = value)` can be written as `value %>% function()`. 

Or even easier, think of it as: .alert["then"], .alert["dann"], or .alert["sÃ¥"].

```{r}
# Piped code
seq(from = 1, to = 13) %>% sqrt() %>% mean()
```

# The `.` .font70[Aka piping to specific arguments]

By default, `%>%` pipes into the *first* argument of a function. .backgrnote[You can find out what the first argument of a function is by typing `?function`.]

```{r}
# Both lines of code round 5.882 to have only one digit.
round(x = 5.882, digits = 1) 
5.882 %>% round(digits = 1)
```

--

The `.` placeholder allows us to pipe into *another* argument.

```{r}
2 %>% round(x = 5.882, digits = .)
```

---
# Why the `.` matters

For many (non-tidyverse functions), the data frame is not the first argument. Make sure to pipe into the argument which you actually intend to feed.

.left-column[
```{r}
t.test(ESS, agea ~ gndr)
```

```{r}
ESS %>% t.test(agea ~ gndr)
```
]

.right-column[
```{r eval = FALSE}
t.test(agea ~ gndr, data = ESS)
```

```{r}

# Advantages of piping .font60[And when not to pipe]

.center[The advantages are:]
 - *Legible code*: We can structure code from left to right, as apposed to from inside and out.
 - *Shorter code*: You minimize the need for local/intermediate variables.
 - *Easily mutable code*: You can easily add steps anywhere in the sequence of operations.

--

.center[.alert[But:]]
 - If you have more than one or two major inputs, don't pipe.
 - If you have more than ca. ten steps, better make intermediate objects.
  + It helps you to debug (i.e., find mistakes) and is simply easier to read.

# Reminder .font70[Weights]

.push-left[
- A *weight* tells you the probability that an observation should be in the sample. .backgrnote[
For a true random sample, each case of the population has an equal probability to be sampled. Thus the weight would be 1 for every observation of a sample.]
-  Some populations tend to be over\under-sampled. Post-stratification weights try to counterbalance this.

- Imagine a patriarchal society, where men's votes count twice. Here we have a ballot on whether women should be allowed to drive:

```{r results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}

Vote <- c("No", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "No")
`Voted yes` <- c(0, 1, 1, 1, 0)
Weight <- c(2, 2, 1, 1, 1)

# **Grouped operations**

Today, we want to compare countries. `group_by()` will transform your data into a **grouped tibble**. Afterwards, certain functions will operate on the level of those specified groups!

```{r comment #}
# Group my data by country.
(ESS_cntry <- ESS %>% 
   group_by(cntry)) #<<
```

---
# Grouped operations .font60[**summarize**]

`summarize()` allows you to calculate *all kinds* of statistics on the level of the groups you have specified.

```{r}
(ESS_cntry <- ESS %>% # use the ESS, then
   mutate( # Generate a numeric 0/1 indicator of religious discrimination.
     rel_discr_num = case_when(rel_discr == "Yes" ~ 1, 
                               rel_discr == "No" ~ 0,
                               TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA))) %>% # then
   group_by(cntry) %>% # group ESS by cntry, then
   dplyr::summarize( # Start summarize function. #<<
     n = n(), # Number of cases,
     wn = sum(pspwght, na.rm = TRUE), # weighted number of cases,
     n_rd = sum(rel_discr_num, na.rm = TRUE), # Cases reporting religious discrimination,
     wn_rd = sum(rel_discr_num * pspwght, na.rm = TRUE), # weighted number of cases who ...,
     perc_rd = (n_rd / n) * 100, # % cases who ...,
     wperc_rd = (wn_rd / wn) * 100 # weighted % who ...,
   )) # End of summarize. #<<
```

---
# Reminder .font70[Standard errors & confidence intervals]

.push-left[
The *standard error* tells you the "standard deviation" of your estimate (i.e., mean, percentage, $\beta$ etc.), if we conducted the same study (i.e., the ESS) over and over again.

Standard error of the mean: $\text{SE}(\bar{x}) = \frac{ \text{SD(x)}}{\sqrt{n}}$

Standard error of a proportion: $\text{SE}(p) = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$

The *95% Confidence Interval* tries to capture the range in which the true value lies with an *accuracy* of 95%.

$$\text{CI}_{95} = \bar{x} \pm \text{Critical Value} * \text{SE}(\bar{x})$$
$$\text{CI}_{95} = p \pm \text{Critical Value} * \text{SE}(p)$$

# General lessons

1. R code can be nested, but alternatively it can also be *piped.* Piping allows you two write more legible code that can be read from left to right and that does not contain several useless intermediate objects.

2. By *grouping* and *summarizing* you can quickly generate all kinds of summary statistics that allow you to describe your research phenomenon just as you want to; at best of course with ggplot2 figures ;)

# Important operators

1. `%>%`: the (forward) pipe, allows you to pipe the output of one function into the next function as input. By default, it will be channeled as value to the first function. `value %>% function(argument1 = value)`.

2. `.`: combined with the pipe, it allows you to pipe input to other arguments than the first.

---
class: inverse
# Important functions
1. `group_by()`: Subsets a tibble into groups. Certain functions will afterwards operate by each of the specified groups.

2. `summarize()`: Allows you to estimate any kind of aggregate statistic. Combined with `group_by()`, it estimates those statistic by specified group.
  - `n()` counts the number of cases within `summarize()`.
  - `sum()` gives you $\sum{}$.
  - `mean()` and `wtd.mean()` give you the average\mean.
  - `sd()` and `wtd.sd() %>% sqrt()` give you the standard deviation.
