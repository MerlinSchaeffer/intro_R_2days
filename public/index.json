[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this first lecture you will get a gentle introduction to the statistical programming language R and some of its basic functionality. The lecture covers different operators, the idea behind R’s workhorse functions, and basic data structures in R. The lecture is a bit abstract, like this line of code:\n(I_am_an_object \u0026lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 8)) # [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 But stay with it, you’ll get the hang of it soon enough. You will also learn about the workflow of using RStudio, including how to set up a project and how to use R Scripts to organize your research and make it reproducible.\nLecture slides: Int_R_oduction\nToday’s exercise: Web Excercise 1\n","date":1666137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666137600,"objectID":"0a2348fb4569041e8241c7e8c121ebce","permalink":"/sessions/1-hello_r_vectors/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/sessions/1-hello_r_vectors/","section":"sessions","summary":"In this first lecture you will get a gentle introduction to the statistical programming language R and some of its basic functionality.","tags":null,"title":"1 Hello R: Vectors","type":"sessions"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This lecture will introduce you to data frames and tibbles, and how to work with them as well as with atomic vectors.
