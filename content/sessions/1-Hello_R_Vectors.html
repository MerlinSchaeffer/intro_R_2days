<p>In this first lecture you will get a gentle intro to R as an objects-oriented statistical programming language and will take your first steps of working with it. The lecture is a bit abstract, like this line of code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(I_am_an_object &lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 8))
# [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</code></pre>
<p>But stay with it, you’ll get the hang of it soon enough. You will also learn about the workflow of using RStudio, including how to set up a project and how to use R Scripts to organize your research and make it reproducible.</p>
