Linear OLS regression is the backbone of statistical modeling and social data science. Most complex models are extensions of linear OLS, and thus you should know your OLS well. In this session you will get a brief recap of multiple OLS with continuous and categorical predictors, learn how to conduct it in R, and how to communicate the results of your linear OLS models in regression tables and coefficient plots.
