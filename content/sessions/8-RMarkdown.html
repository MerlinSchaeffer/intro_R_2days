Dynamic documents combine analysis script and final report, presentation or website in one document. This has many advantages and means that the results in your final paper, or in your presentation are always up to date. In this session you will learn how to write a final paper that entails all R analysis code and output using R Markdown. It is a great investment to make. As you will see, R Markdown is quite straight forward to learn. But it will allow you to even program websites and blogs. I wrote all slides for this course and even this website with R Markdown!
